/*
 Write a recursive method to print a Syracuse sequence
 that begins with a number n0 and each element ni of 
 the sequence is ni-1 /2 if ni-1 is even and 3ni-1 + 1 otherwise.
 The sequence ends with 1.

For instance, starting with n = 12, one gets the sequence 12, 6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.
